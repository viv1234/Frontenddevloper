                                as glucose levels, blood pressure, and heart rate.

                                clinical outcomes set in the disease management program.

                                Artificial Intelligence - How Machine Learning is Transforming Underwriting

                            </h5>
                            <p>Over the last decade, several sectors of the economy adopted and implemented digital
                                technologies to improve business connections and maximize output and efficiency.
                                However, the insurance industry is one of the staidest sectors of the economy lagged
                                behind in the global shift to digital technology.
                            </p>
                            <p>As such, the Indian Insurance industry is now transforming and adopting digital
                                transformation. Nevertheless, with the integration of technologies like artificial
                                intelligence, advanced analytics, and machine learning from distribution to claims to
                                underwriting, the age of digital insurance is here.
                            </p>
                            <p>The insurance industry is now in a race to catch up with all the possibilities
                                digitalization, specifically, artificial intelligence has to offer to both the insurers
                                and the insured. Artificial intelligence - AI, is one of the key components of the
                                digital age of insurance.
                            </p>
                            <h5 class="green">Risk Assessment
                            </h5>
                            <p>The job of an insurance underwriter is to analyze and evaluate the potential risks
                                involved in the process of ensuring applicants and their assets. This risk assessment
                                is carried out based on the information provided in the application by the applicants.
                            </p>
                            <p>However, there is usually no assurance that information provided is accurate. In a
                                situation where false information is given or the client purposely omits vital
                                information in the application, the essence of an underwriter is invalidated as using
                                wrong information to conduct a risk assessment is void. With the integration of natural
                                language understanding (NLU), a subset of machine learning in the underwriting process,
                                insurance underwriters will have access more sources of information that will reveal
                                more information about a potential client allowing for a more effective and efficient
                                risk assessment. These sources of information range from Social Media, Hospitals,
                                Diagnostic Centers, Work-Shops, Loss Assessors etc.
                            </p>
                            <p>Machine Learning will further aid underwriters to improve the efficiency of the risk
                                assessment process by providing relevant information through its textual data sources.
                                Machine learning in underwriting will be able to consume more data automatically, There
                                will be scope to see more customization, and customers will benefit by paying for
                                coverage they truly need. Essentially, effective risk assessment translates to a better
                                pricing for insurable risk which will prove itself beneficial in the long run to both
                                the insurers and clients.

                            </h5>
                            <p>The insurance sector is constantly plagued with stories of fraudulent claims and
                                artificial intelligence is the solution to this issue.

                            </p>
                            <p>Machine learning algorithms can detect correlations and patterns that are likely to beat
                                human intelligence and may go by unperceived in the evaluation process. Beyond
                                detecting fraudulent claims, the machine algorithms also provide an assessment of the
                                repair cost, the potential liability of the claims and control measures to combat
                                further fraudulent claim reporting.

                            </p>
                            <p>We at eiCore Tech believe that artificial intelligence is set to transform the insurance
                                industry. We have initiated the efforts to integrate AI technology in fraud prevention
                                systems.

                            </h5>
                            <p>Human beings are inherently prone to errors which is one of a major deficiency of a
                                human-based system. On the other hand, a digitalized system is much more accurate and
                                efficient than human operations. This is exactly what artificial intelligence in
                                insurance will do - improve the efficiency of the system. Machine learning algorithms
                                assess and check for errors present in information on the system in a substantially
                                shorter amount of time than it would take for a human being do the job.

                            </p>
                            <p>In addition to checking for mistakes at a time-effective rate, ML algorithms will also
                                eliminate the need for third-party operations between the insurer and the client,
                                effectively enhancing the insurer-insured relationship for better products and
                                services.
